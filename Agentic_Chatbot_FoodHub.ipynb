    "The number of online food delivery orders is increasing rapidly in cities, driven by students, working professionals, and families with busy schedules. Customers frequently raise queries about their orders, such as delivery time, order status, payment details, or return/replacement policies. Currently, most of these queries are managed manually by customer support teams, which often results in long wait times, inconsistent responses, and higher operational costs.\n",

Since the app already maintains structured order information in its database, there is a strong opportunity to leverage this data through intelligent systems that can directly interact with customers in real time."
